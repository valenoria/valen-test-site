> I'm a Computer Systems Engineer. With a great passion on development of new technologies and love for art

Since I was a little kid I always enjoyed challenges, videogames, computers and drawing so much that during my childhood I entered various drawing contest and Math Olympics at my schools. Which eventually led me to choose an engineering career... I got my degree from "Universidad APEC" at the Dominican Republic and, before graduating, I started working at Grupo Peña Defilló where I got to know about Low Code in Appian and since then I've been really into the developing world. Nowadays I'm an Appian Certified Associate Developer, teach about low-code at my Alma Mater and learn about Web Development and Design.
